Files:
- bisectionmethod.py: This file encompases the use of the Bisection Method for numerical approximation of a function's real zero. To change this for future uses first change the function within the eval() method. Specifically, replace the hard written function with your desired function. Next, change the threshold accuracy Es to your desired threshold. Lastly, there is the capability of graphing the function by uncommenting 'mkGraph()' within Main(). As well, there are two options for presenting a data table found within the mkTable() method.

- falsepositivemethod.py: This file encompases the use of the False Positive Method for numerical approximation of a function's real zero. To change this for future uses follow the instructions associated with 'bisectionmethod.py' file.
